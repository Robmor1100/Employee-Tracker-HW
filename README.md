## Usage

 When the application starts, the user is given options on what they can do next inside their terminal. For example, this application lets you add or view departments, employees, and roles. Just follow the instructions in your terminal to navigate through these options.


## Roadmap

I would like to add the option to choose from the actual roles instead of just inputting the role id.
